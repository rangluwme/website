<span class="section-title">Abstract </span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In this study, an artificial wetland filler matrix capable of effectively fixing phosphorus was prepared using a non-combustion process to save energy. To evaluate the adsorption performance of this filler, adsorption experiments were performed and the phosphorus adsorption mechanism characterization was studied. An alkaline environment was found to be conducive to the increase of adsorption capacity, but excessive alkalinity was not conducive to adsorption. Static adsorption experiments showed that the phosphorus removal rate could reach 95% in the simulated phosphorus-containing wastewater after adsorption completion. The adsorption process is closely simulated by the pseudo-second-kinetic adsorption model. The isothermal adsorption experiment data were consistent with the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The characterization results showed a large number of micropores and adsorption binding sites inside and on the surface of the filler. Speciation analysis on the adsorbed phosphorus revealed that chemisorption by calcium in this filler was the dominant adsorption mechanism. The research results of this study provide the basis and reference for the development of high-efficiency phosphorus removal filler in constructed wetlands.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"> The filler in this study is a new type of non-combustion filler made from feed waterworks sludge and aluminium slag as its main components. It has the advantages of energy savings and environmental protection, as well as a good phosphorus removal effect. The filler phosphorus adsorption capacity increases with increasing contact time, reaching equilibrium after approximately 10 h. The adsorption rate is first fast and then slower, which is consistent with a pseudo-second-order kinetic adsorption model. The isothermal adsorption process follows the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The research results of this paper provide the basis and reference for the development of high-efficiency phosphorus removal filler in constructed wetland.

          Based on the adsorption kinetics curve, the filler adsorption process can be characterized by ‘rapid adsorption and slow equilibrium’. During the period of 0–10 h, the amount of phosphorus adsorbed by the filler increased rapidly with time. This was because at the initial stage of the adsorption process, there were more active adsorption sites on the filler surface, which adsorbed many ions. The concentration gradient of adsorbed substances formed on the solid–liquid surface was also large, which was beneficial to physical adsorption and ligand exchange with the adsorption sites in the filler surface (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586606000396?via%3Dihub">Yang et al. 2006</a>). This period of time was a rapid adsorption process, but as the adsorption time was prolonged, the active adsorption sites on the filler surface gradually decreased, and the rate of the adsorption reaction slowed. In this process, the phosphorus was adsorbed by the diffusion of the internal microporous mesoporous of the filler (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749109002103?via%3Dihub"> Babatunde et al. 2009</a>). This was a slow adsorption process. With increasing initial phosphorus content, the phosphorus adsorption amount was significantly increased, because the exchange driving force generated under the condition of high phosphorus concentration was large, so the adsorption sites on the filler surface could adsorb enough phosphorus.

        The filler phosphorus adsorption process can be divided into two processes. During the first process, the phosphorus compound was gradually transferred from the liquid phase body to the filler surface. The second process was the diffusion of the phosphorus compound inside the filler. Since the initial concentration of phosphorus was high, the resistance to separation from the liquid phase water solvent to the filler surface was large, which caused the speed from the aqueous phase to the outside of the filler to be slow. However, inside the packing, the situation was reversed, and the diffusion and transfer of the phosphorus compound was easier and faster. This is because inside the packing, the phosphorus compound is surrounded by tiny pores with strong adsorption in the space. From the perspective of the overall adsorption process, when the concentration was high, the external diffusion and transfer process played an important leading role. When the concentration was low, its diffusion inside the filler was the main factor controlling the adsorption rate.
